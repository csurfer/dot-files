# dot-files

These are the collection of my dot files, stored in this repository to ensure I have all the shortcuts configurations in one place. These commands are constructed by patching several other configurations found over the net edited to suit my needs.

## tmux.conf
- `cp tmux.conf ~/.tmux.conf`
- To enable the new configuration file, use `tmux source ~/.tmux.conf`
- To enable the changes you make to configuration file `Ctrl + B` then `Shift + I`
